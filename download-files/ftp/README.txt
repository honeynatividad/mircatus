This is a quick fix for OpenCart new extension installer which just replaces the FTP step with a local copy one. That means that you will install modules through the OpenCart installer without the need to enter FTP credentials to your store settings. 

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------------------
Please find the file localcopy.ocmod.xml and upload it in the Extension Installer of your OpenCart. Then go to Extensions > Modifications and hit the blue "Refresh" button in the upper right corner under the notification icon. Please make sure that you click the blue refresh button and not the browser refresh button.

WHAT IS THIS MODULE DOING
--------------------------------
If you cannot install OpenCart extensions via the Extension Installer, and you get an error  saying "Could not connect as ......" while uploading your zipped extensions via the Extension Installer, you probably have FTP support issue. This module solves this problem by circumventing the need of FTP at all, as it copies the file locally.

WHAT IS THIS MODULE NOT DOING
--------------------------------
This is not a fix for other OCMOD related errors like a corrupted modification file or permission issues.
